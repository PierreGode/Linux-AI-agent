# Linux-AI-agent
An AI agent that will execute tasks in your system.

## Notes

The agent now includes guidance to avoid mixing up service ports. When
troubleshooting networked applications such as Docker containers, verify the
expected port mapping and test connectivity from both the host and any peer
containers.

## Scenario Library

See [SCENARIOS.md](SCENARIOS.md) for fifty example Linux issues ranging from
package manager failures to Docker misconfigurations. They can be used to test
and harden the agent against a wide variety of realâ€‘world situations.
